Ultimately the class addresses the following questions: \"Are we in the\n6th Mass Extinction?\", and \"Are we in a new geologic time, the\nAnthropocene?\" Students will experience events throughout New York City and\nbeyond related to critical environmental issues, including local field\ntrips, talks, and screenings that highlight course topics.

The class will\nincorporate the study of several traditions in which the particular mode or\ngenre is practiced and studied globally. All classes will involve the\nstudent in some form of collaboration (group presentations, team-teaching a\ntext, interviewing same subject, co-authoring, etc.), and will also include\nsome treatment of how writing in the mode under consideration and its\nanalysis is transferable to other kinds of writing practices.",

The course will be centered on student observations of the interactions of startup founders & their potential investors. After familiarizing themselves w/ the startups' ideas, students will apply basic analytical tools, drawn from mgmt, econ, and finance to evaluate the size of markets, attractiveness of industries, financing options of early-stage ventures, sustainable competitive advantage of proposed strategies, & the risks and potential of ideas. Along w/ the experiential component, the course will introduce students to a framework for developing an entrepreneurial strategy. Due to the course’s special circumstances, which involve working with new companies seeking capital: 1) students sign a non-disclosure agreement, 2) penalty is imposed for missed classes, 3) interested students must apply to the course to be considered. The course will run over the Fall and Spring with students working in teams.",

How do you negotiate when emotions are running high? How does understanding the information conveyed by body language (yours and your counterparts) increase the likelihood you will reach a desirable outcome. Is your counterpart a Friend or a Foe? Knowing how you and your counterpart are feeling—angry, fearful, satisfied—is especially important when you want to create the trust needed to reach pie-maximizing outcomes. In this course you will learn how to anticipate emotion and how best to convey understanding without compromising your negotiation objectives. Understanding nonverbal cues enables you to assess when you can trust the other side and when you must be wary of their intentions. Through negotiation simulations in which the economic and emotional stakes are high you will practice ways to plan for the emotions that may arise and the techniques that effectively leverage and/or dissipate emotion. You will also have the opportunity to practice spotting and interpreting nonverbal cues by reviewing videotaped conversations and by analyzing your and your counterparts behavior during a negotiation simulation. CCN is the only pre-requisite. The course complements other Advanced Topics in Negotiation courses and Negotiating Complex Transactions with Executives & Lawyers, which can be taken concurrently or in any order.",

    "description": "In this innovative and practical course students from the Law school and the Business school come together at Stern to learn what it takes to negotiate major transactions Most key corporate deals such as mergers financing international joint ventures and settlements are legal business problems So it crucial for lawyers and business people to know how to work well together and how to design wise agreements To develop these skills students negotiate a variety of simulated transactions and conflicts They take one deal from concept to term sheet to contract and then see its effects months later They grapple with whether to sue or settle They even trade roles at least once They also examine real agreements perhaps meeting and questioning guest speakers who actually negotiated them They also discover ways to design better transactions with the help of economics and other important theoretical tools Through their continuing work together they overcome their natural feelings of professional culture shock and learn how to work as a team to create sound agreements as their future employers expect them to do. A basic course on negotiation such as Collaboration Conflict Negotiation MGMT-GB.2159 or Lawyering LAW-LW 10687 is a prerequisite for the course; there is no prerequisite for LLMs. The course is different from Stern's Advanced Topics in Negotiation which focuses mainly on negotiating in organizations.  (While the course will end December 20, no final and assignments are scheduled, which gives law students time to prepare for other final exams.)",

In this course we will tackle such questions as: How and why are dominant standards chosen in winner-take-all industries. How do firms choose among multiple attractive innovation projects? How do firms decide whether go go it alone or collaborate and how do firms develop an effective collaboration strategy?How do firms make the difficult choice between protecting their technologies with patents or copyrights versus rapidly disseminating them to build installed base and complementary goods? The course will be lecture case and discussion based. Like the industries we will study the course will be fast-paced challenging and exciting.",

In addition, we will spend more time on the relationship between strategy and organizational attributes of the firm. This course has an emphasis on applying the tools and concepts of strategy with precision and attention to nuance. The cases are chosen because they fulfill the following criteria: 1) The issues addressed are topical 2) They are more nuanced than typical core strategy cases 3) They generate an opportunity to explore related regulatory, technological, social, or organizational content  4) They generate interesting follow up questions.  By thoroughly discussing each case and by following up with additional information relevant to the uncertainties faced by the case protagonists, we will generate insights into the challenges of implementing various options. In this course, we seek answers to the following questions: What could go wrong? How do we correct it through better design of structure? The course follows an interactive\t discussion driven format. My expectation is that you come to class having thoroughly read the assignments for that class. Generally, 3-4 class sessions are led by guests who have many years of experience in the industry under consideration. In addition, some class sessions set aside for group presentations.",

    "deptCourseId": "2107",
    "description": "The objective of this class is to guide students through the complex, exhilarating, and sometimes surprising journey of discovering the right career for them, one rich with opportunity, meaning, and impact. “Becoming You” grows out of the premise that the happiest, most fulfilling lives are those lived in your “Area of Destiny,” the intersection of your best and most unique skills, your deepest and most authentic values, and the economy’s most rewarding spaces. On many levels, the Area of Destiny construct is intuitive – of course you should be doing what you’re good at, what you love, and what the world needs. But what’s less intuitive is how often smart, ambitious, and often enlightened people end up with lives and careers that are less deliberate and joyful, and more accidental and stressful, than they’d ever wanted. With readings from memoirs that are as illuminating as they are brutally honest (Tina Fey, Steve Wozniak, and Phil Knight), spell-binding documentaries about trailblazers such as Dr. Dre and Iris Apfel (to name a few), as well as classical works about identity by great philosophers and social scientists, “Becoming You” will explore career journeys that are provocative – and instructive. But the career journey at the center of this class is yours. Where have you been and how has it shaped you? What are you dying to leave behind, and what is ahead that scares you? What is your unedited dream of a life? What are your non-negotiables around lifestyle? Do you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur? And what about money…really? Analytic tools, assessment surveys, and exercises will be employed in each student’s personal exploration process, along with team activities, writing assignments, and guest speakers from careers paths both conventional and unorthodox. The course will conclude with a capstone project in which each student will identify their own “Area of Destiny,” either newly discovered or confirmed, and the roadmap to it, now and in the future.",

    "description": "Businesses and governments now face a growing and immediate array of nonfinancial risks, including climate-related, cyber and operational, and geopolitical risks. Precisely because these critical risks are hard to measure and analyze, firms are putting new resources – people and money– to work to anticipate, manage and mitigate them. To address cybersecurity risks, for example, JP Morgan alone has 3000 employees and spends $600 million annually. Firms are only starting to grapple with existential climate-related risks. And startups are mushrooming to provide assessments to businesses. This course will study these risks alongside financial risks. It will outline frameworks for measuring, assessing and analyzing them, and for actions needed to meet them. We will examine case studies of climate, cyber and geopolitical risks, including from current events. Finally, we will study whether and how the information in financial markets can both inform the assessment of these risks and potentially provide tools to transfer, insure against or hedge them.",

It is about valuing small businesses and big ones, simple businesses and complex ones, young firms, and those in distress. It is about valuing individual assets, as well as portfolios, and it looks at valuation from every conceivable perspective, as an investor, a trader, a business owner, or a manager. It is about valuation in all its many forms and by the end of this class, you should be able to value just about anything that has a value and price just about everything else. ",

In addition to honing their analytical skills by organizing all activities related to institutional asset management students gain experience in financial writing and oral presentations advancing financial decisions in a group setting and handling all of the governance and fiduciary responsibilities of a university endowment fund. The central mission of this course is for students to learn through having practical hands-on investment management experience. Because of the time requirements in formulating an investment strategy screening and reviewing prospective stocks updating the status and performance of existing positions and all of the ancillary duties connected with the operation of a real live portfolio the experiential or hands-on component consumes the bulk of class time However a related mission is for students to acquire knowledge about institutional funds management and current industry practices and trends. This more traditional learning experience comes through readings and presentations from industry professionals. The endowment funds under management operate as the Michael Price Student Investment Fund MPSIF. The Fund began in early 2000 thanks to a generous gift from Michael F Price. During its short life MPSIF has been a very popular course that helps Stern students to differentiate themselves by providing valuable experience for careers in asset management and related fields. For more detailed information about MPSIF see the website at stern.nyu.edu/~mpsif and in particular The MPSIF Guidebook that is available at the site.",

    "description": "FinTech refers to financial sector innovations involving technology-enabled business models that can facilitate disintermediation, revolutionize how existing firms create and\ndeliver products and services, address privacy, regulatory and law-enforcement challenges, provide new gateways for entrepreneurship, and seed opportunities for inclusive growth.\n\nFinTech is also the label for increasingly technological approaches to the main financial intermediation functions: payments, capital raising, remittances, managing uncertainty and risk, market price discovery, and mediating information asymmetry and incentives. In today’s FinTech businesses, consumers bank via mobile apps integrated into social media, institutions trade electronically, and robo-advisers make decisions about investment portfolios. \n\nThis inter-departmental course provides an introduction to the emerging FinTech discipline. It is intended to be the starting point for Stern students who may take additional electives in the FinTech area, while also providing an overview of the area for students who intend to take only one FinTech course.\n\nThe course will study:\n\n• How is financial innovation different than industrial innovation? How is financial innovation evolving? What are the light sides and dark sides of financial innovation?\n\n• Will traditional financial intermediaries be able to adapt? Or will upstart FinTechs disrupt them, re-imagining business models just as Amazon reshaped book-selling and Uber transformed taxi-rides?\n\n• What are the critical technology strategies and foundational technologies in FinTech?\n\n• What are the core and novel sources of FinTech data, how are they managed?\n\nHow is data visualization evolving?\n\n• What are the primary FinTech data science methods and tools? How do they apply to real FinTech problems and questions today?\n\n• How is FinTech reconfiguring financial services business models? What are the key disruption points? What determines success in FinTech?\n\n• Where are the limits, risks, and broader policy and social implications of FinTech?",

As such, the Leadership Fellows curriculum is heavily focused on practice. Fellows will practice working through difficult workplace scenarios with professional role players, be given the opportunity to reflect on their behavior, and provide / receive feedback from their cohort members. Further, they will be afforded the opportunity to test their learning by repeating the experience. The purpose of this practice is to position students as leaders within their organizations after Stern. By practicing and experiencing the emotions and rushing thoughts that arise under pressure, students will rise to the occasion, carry themselves with greater confidence and purpose, and be seen as people who are seasoned beyond their years.",

This helps us understand their narrative, drill into their financial statements, and assess competitive advantage. \n\nThe analysis proceeds as follows:\n\n(1) We apply the Six-Pack Framework for a top-down and comprehensive analysis of financial statements to extract the six key inputs into valuation - Size, Growth, Margins, Asset intensity, Business risk, and Financial risk. \n\n(2) We analyze how these inputs depend upon a company’s strategy by computing the Competitive Advantage Score that assigns weights to competitive drivers and scores the company’s strength on those drivers.\n\nThis broad exposure will expand your strategic horizons and enable you to foresee challenges and opportunities due to changing competition, technology, and environment. The framework and the perspective will sharpen your ability to lead value creation as an entrepreneur or executive, or to understand value creation as an investor, banker, analyst, or consultant.",

For students seeking careers in the institutional real estate industry in New York and other global cities, interaction with cross-border investors, lenders, property technology entrepreneurs, and others will be the norm rather than the exception. This course introduces students to real estate finance and investment analysis in non-US settings, special issues when deploying equity and debt capital internationally, and approaches to analyzing global real estate portfolios. The highly experiential course is structured around direct interaction with global real estate developers, investors, lenders, and policymakers in a major non-US market, supplemented by pre-departure meetings in December and January, local site visits, and case-based deliverables.",

Specifically:\n\n \n\n1) You will learn about the types of traps that lure business professionals into ethical lapses and criminal behaviors.\n\n2) You will learn enough moral psychology to understand how well-intentioned professionals can get lured into such traps.\n\n3) You will learn conceptual frameworks that help you to navigate ethical gray zones with more confidence and better results.\n\n4) You will learn what characterizes companies with positive ethical values, and why you are better off working for them, or creating them.\n\n5) You may, if you choose, commit yourself to a standard of professional conduct that will help to make your work more fulfilling and honorable.",
