The course will be centered on student observations of the interactions of startup founders & their potential investors. After familiarizing themselves w/ the startups' ideas, students will apply basic analytical tools, drawn from mgmt, econ, and finance to evaluate the size of markets, attractiveness of industries, financing options of early-stage ventures, sustainable competitive advantage of proposed strategies, & the risks and potential of ideas. Along w/ the experiential component, the course will introduce students to a framework for developing an entrepreneurial strategy. Due to the course’s special circumstances, which involve working with new companies seeking capital: 1) students sign a non-disclosure agreement, 2) penalty is imposed for missed classes, 3) interested students must apply to the course to be considered. The course will run over the Fall and Spring with students working in teams.",

    "description": "The goal of this course is to increase your ability to resolve conflicts at the bargaining table and a a leader in your organization. How do you negotiate when emotions are running high? How does understanding the information conveyed by body language (yours and your counterparts) increase the likelihood you will reach a desirable outcome. Is your counterpart a Friend or a Foe? Knowing how you and your counterpart are feeling—angry, fearful, satisfied—is especially important when you want to create the trust needed to reach pie-maximizing outcomes. In this course you will learn how to anticipate emotion and how best to convey understanding without compromising your negotiation objectives. Understanding nonverbal cues enables you to assess when you can trust the other side and when you must be wary of their intentions. Through negotiation simulations in which the economic and emotional stakes are high you will practice ways to plan for the emotions that may arise and the techniques that effectively leverage and/or dissipate emotion. You will also have the opportunity to practice spotting and interpreting nonverbal cues by reviewing videotaped conversations and by analyzing your and your counterparts behavior during a negotiation simulation. CCN is the only pre-requisite. The course complements other Advanced Topics in Negotiation courses and Negotiating Complex Transactions with Executives & Lawyers, which can be taken concurrently or in any order.",

    "description": "In this innovative and practical course students from the Law school and the Business school come together at Stern to learn what it takes to negotiate major transactions Most key corporate deals such as mergers financing international joint ventures and settlements are legal business problems So it crucial for lawyers and business people to know how to work well together and how to design wise agreements To develop these skills students negotiate a variety of simulated transactions and conflicts They take one deal from concept to term sheet to contract and then see its effects months later They grapple with whether to sue or settle They even trade roles at least once They also examine real agreements perhaps meeting and questioning guest speakers who actually negotiated them They also discover ways to design better transactions with the help of economics and other important theoretical tools Through their continuing work together they overcome their natural feelings of professional culture shock and learn how to work as a team to create sound agreements as their future employers expect them to do. A basic course on negotiation such as Collaboration Conflict Negotiation MGMT-GB.2159 or Lawyering LAW-LW 10687 is a prerequisite for the course; there is no prerequisite for LLMs. The course is different from Stern's Advanced Topics in Negotiation which focuses mainly on negotiating in organizations.  (While the course will end December 20, no final and assignments are scheduled, which gives law students time to prepare for other final exams.)",

It is appropriate for those interested in organizational performance from a managerial or external perspective, e.g. management consultants, investment bankers, and financial analysts. It examines organizations' attempts to adapt as open systems in a competitive environment. We consider the major factors influencing organization design, e.g. strategy, environment, and technology. Then we analyze the major internal processes affecting organizational performance, e.g.\t control systems, politics, and conflict. Next, we probe how organizations can improve their ability to adapt in increasingly dynamic environments. The course includes domestic and international examples. The main learning methods are case analyses and a study of the organizations of the central competitors in an industry or industries that the class chooses. Particular emphasis is placed on organizational-level problems facing senior management.",

    "description": "Contemporary business environments contain challenges that demand an increasing pace, volume, and complexity of organizational changes. Most organizations, whether they are entrepreneurial start-ups or long-established Fortune 500 firms, find that they must change or wither. This course is geared toward deepening students' understanding of the challenges, techniques, and burdens associated with initiating and implementing major change in an organization. The objective is to prepare managers, or their consultants and advisers, to meet the challenges of organizational change successfully. As such, the course is especially useful for students who plan careers in management consulting, general management (whether in line or staff positions), and entrepreneurship or corporate venturing.",

In addition, we will spend more time on the relationship between strategy and organizational attributes of the firm. This course has an emphasis on applying the tools and concepts of strategy with precision and attention to nuance. The cases are chosen because they fulfill the following criteria: 1) The issues addressed are topical 2) They are more nuanced than typical core strategy cases 3) They generate an opportunity to explore related regulatory, technological, social, or organizational content  4) They generate interesting follow up questions.  By thoroughly discussing each case and by following up with additional information relevant to the uncertainties faced by the case protagonists, we will generate insights into the challenges of implementing various options. In this course, we seek answers to the following questions: What could go wrong? How do we correct it through better design of structure? The course follows an interactive\t discussion driven format. My expectation is that you come to class having thoroughly read the assignments for that class. Generally, 3-4 class sessions are led by guests who have many years of experience in the industry under consideration. In addition, some class sessions set aside for group presentations.",

    "description": "The objective of this class is to guide students through the complex, exhilarating, and sometimes surprising journey of discovering the right career for them, one rich with opportunity, meaning, and impact. “Becoming You” grows out of the premise that the happiest, most fulfilling lives are those lived in your “Area of Destiny,” the intersection of your best and most unique skills, your deepest and most authentic values, and the economy’s most rewarding spaces. On many levels, the Area of Destiny construct is intuitive – of course you should be doing what you’re good at, what you love, and what the world needs. But what’s less intuitive is how often smart, ambitious, and often enlightened people end up with lives and careers that are less deliberate and joyful, and more accidental and stressful, than they’d ever wanted. With readings from memoirs that are as illuminating as they are brutally honest (Tina Fey, Steve Wozniak, and Phil Knight), spell-binding documentaries about trailblazers such as Dr. Dre and Iris Apfel (to name a few), as well as classical works about identity by great philosophers and social scientists, “Becoming You” will explore career journeys that are provocative – and instructive. But the career journey at the center of this class is yours. Where have you been and how has it shaped you? What are you dying to leave behind, and what is ahead that scares you? What is your unedited dream of a life? What are your non-negotiables around lifestyle? Do you have what it takes to be an entrepreneur? And what about money…really? Analytic tools, assessment surveys, and exercises will be employed in each student’s personal exploration process, along with team activities, writing assignments, and guest speakers from careers paths both conventional and unorthodox. The course will conclude with a capstone project in which each student will identify their own “Area of Destiny,” either newly discovered or confirmed, and the roadmap to it, now and in the future.",

    "description": "This course is designed to offer a thorough understanding of Value Investing principles and techniques from the perspective of professional practitioners. The course aims to prepare students to understand, evaluate, and invest using a Global Value Investment Philosophy in all asset classes (i.e. Securities, Real Estate, and Hard Assets). Students will be exposed to Value Investment Valuation methods, strategies and techniques. The course will feature a combination of lectures by the professor and guest speakers who are expert in different facets of the Value Investing paradigm. An important part of the course is a term project for each student to prepare an investment analysis and oral presentation (or pitch) to a panel of investment professionals.

    "description": "Managing Investment Funds is a capstone course that requires students to draw on their knowledge of finance as well as macroeconomics accounting competitive analysis strategy marketing and other fields to manage a  million endowment fund held by New York University. In addition to honing their analytical skills by organizing all activities related to institutional asset management students gain experience in financial writing and oral presentations advancing financial decisions in a group setting and handling all of the governance and fiduciary responsibilities of a university endowment fund. The central mission of this course is for students to learn through having practical hands-on investment management experience. Because of the time requirements in formulating an investment strategy screening and reviewing prospective stocks updating the status and performance of existing positions and all of the ancillary duties connected with the operation of a real live portfolio the experiential or hands-on component consumes the bulk of class time However a related mission is for students to acquire knowledge about institutional funds management and current industry practices and trends. This more traditional learning experience comes through readings and presentations from industry professionals. The endowment funds under management operate as the Michael Price Student Investment Fund MPSIF. The Fund began in early 2000 thanks to a generous gift from Michael F Price. During its short life MPSIF has been a very popular course that helps Stern students to differentiate themselves by providing valuable experience for careers in asset management and related fields. For more detailed information about MPSIF see the website at stern.nyu.edu/~mpsif and in particular The MPSIF Guidebook that is available at the site.",

For students seeking careers in the institutional real estate industry in New York and other global cities, interaction with cross-border investors, lenders, property technology entrepreneurs, and others will be the norm rather than the exception. This course introduces students to real estate finance and investment analysis in non-US settings, special issues when deploying equity and debt capital internationally, and approaches to analyzing global real estate portfolios. The highly experiential course is structured around direct interaction with global real estate developers, investors, lenders, and policymakers in a major non-US market, supplemented by pre-departure meetings in December and January, local site visits, and case-based deliverables.",
