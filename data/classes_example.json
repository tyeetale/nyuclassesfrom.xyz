We will read two introductory texts in English and French that I published on this topic recently. From the fourth session on we will read classical Arabic texts from Transoxania written by jurists of the eleventh and twelfth centuries who – still today – exert a strong influence on the interpretation of Islamic Law in the Arab World and in Turkey.\u003c/p\u003e",
