Make NYU course search fast.

If we think Harvard's online catalog is slow... we don't even have a graphQL endpoint at NYU XD.

All points aside, the network is huge, and it's very annoying to wait for a online catalog search.
Furthermore, NYU's status as a global campus with over 40+ locations globally makes it more hard to manage from a catagorical point of view.

Different schools, different classes, and different timezones all blend together to be a slow process.

As such, this project is an attempt to gather fast results for course search, as inspired from classes.wtf, coded in svelte, go, and redis.
